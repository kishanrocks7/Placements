int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int candidate=0;
        int count=0;
        for(auto num:nums)
        {
            if(count==0)
            {
                candidate=num;
            }
            if(num==candidate)
            {
                count++;
            }
            else
            {
                count--;
            }
        }
        return candidate;
        
    }
    
    what we are doing here is by intution we know if number is ocurring more tham n/2 times we cant have more than a single number so we have a candidate varibale wich will be our
    answer so iteratinf among the array using iterator if our count is 0 we will update candidate to nums
    if nums is = candidate than we will increment the count, else we will decrement the count
    at the last num we will have out required value in candidate variable
