what we can do here is as we know it sorted in both directions so
running the loop from back of first row that is last column and from the first row
so if we finf the target numner < than the top right corner element we will decrement column and check if it is present in that row or not
if number is greater than we will increment the row number and will iterate untill we get the elemtnst
